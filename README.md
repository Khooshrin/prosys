## Technologies Used

- Front-end: React.js, Material UI
- Back-end: Node.js (Express)
- Database: MongoDB (Mongoose)

## Acknowledgments

The ProSys project was developed from January 2023 to April 2023 as part of the Software Engineering course at BITS Pilani, Hyderabad. Throughout the development process, the team adhered to Scrum guidelines and followed Agile principles.

The successful implementation of the project proposal management system was met with praise from the professor. We would like to express our gratitude to the professor for his guidance and support throughout the project.
